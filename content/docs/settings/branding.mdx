## Accessing Branding Settings

1. Go to **Settings** in the sidebar.
2. Navigate to **Business Branding** (or **العلامة التجارية** in Arabic).

## What You Can Customize

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Brand Name** | Your brand name as displayed across the system |
| **Logo** | Upload your business logo |
| **Favicon** | The small icon shown in browser tabs |
| **Color Scheme** | Primary brand colors |

## Uploading Your Logo

1. In the Branding settings, find the **Logo** section.
2. Click **Upload** and select your logo file.
3. The logo appears in the header of your portal and on receipts.

## How Branding Applies

Your branding settings affect:

- **Portal Header** — Your logo and brand name appear in the navigation bar
- **Receipts** — Your logo and brand name print on receipts (if enabled in [Receipt Settings](/docs/stores/receipt-settings))
- **[Online Store](/docs/online-store/storefront-overview)** — Your logo appears on your storefront

<Callout title="Tip">
Use a clear, high-quality logo that looks good at small sizes. PNG format with a transparent background works best.
