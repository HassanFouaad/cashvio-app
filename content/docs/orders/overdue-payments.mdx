## What are Overdue Payments?

When an order is not fully paid at the time of creation, the remaining amount becomes a **pending payment**. If this amount is not paid by the expected due date, it becomes **overdue**.

The **Overdue Payments** page helps you track all orders that still have outstanding balances.

## Accessing Overdue Payments

Go to **Sales > Overdue Payments** in the sidebar.

## What You See

The page shows a table of orders with pending payments:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Order Number** | The order with pending payment |
| **Customer** | Who owes the payment |
| **Due Date** | When the payment was expected |
| **Amount Due** | How much is still owed |
| **Days Overdue** | How many days past the due date |

## Filtering Overdue Payments

You can filter the list by:

- **Show All** — See all pending payments
- **Overdue** — Only show payments past their due date
- **Due Soon** — Show payments due within a specified number of days (default: 7 days)

## Managing an Overdue Payment

1. Click on a payment row to open the related **Order Details**.
2. From the order details, you can:
   - **Add Payment** — Record a payment against the outstanding balance.
   - **Update Due Date** — Change the due date if the customer needs more time.

## How Payments Affect Order Status

| Payment State | Order Payment Status |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **Fully paid** | Paid |
| **Partially paid** | Partially Paid |
| **No payment** | Unpaid |
| **Past due date** | Overdue |

<Callout title="Tip">
Regularly review the Overdue Payments page to stay on top of outstanding balances. Following up promptly on overdue payments helps maintain healthy cash flow.
