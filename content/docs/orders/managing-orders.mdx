## Viewing All Orders

1. Go to **Sales > All Sales** in the sidebar.
2. You will see a table of all orders with columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Order Number** | Unique identifier for each order |
| **Customer** | The customer who placed the order |
| **Store** | Which store the order belongs to |
| **Order Source** | Where the order was created — **Web** (business portal) or **Storefront** (online store) |

| **Payment Status** | Whether the order is paid, partially paid, or unpaid |

## Filtering Orders

Use the filter bar to narrow down your orders:

- **Order Number** — Search by order number

- **Customer** — Filter by customer name
- **Fulfillment Status** — Filter by fulfillment status (Pending, Preparing, Ready, Delivering, Completed, Cancelled)
- **Payment Status** — Filter by payment status

### Order Payments Section

The order details page includes an **Order Payments** section that lists every individual payment transaction for the order. Each payment record shows:

| **Payment Method** | The method used (Cash, Online, Receipt, Store Credit) |
| **Amount** | The payment amount |

## Updating Fulfillment Status

To update an order's fulfillment status:

1. Open the order details.
2. Click **Update Fulfillment** (or the status update button).
3. Select the new status from the available options.
4. Confirm the update.

The available statuses depend on the current status and fulfillment method. See [Fulfillment Methods](/docs/stores/fulfillment-methods) for the full status flow.

## Adding a Payment

If an order has an outstanding balance:

1. Open the order details.
2. Click **Add Payment**.
3. Select the payment method (Cash, Online, or Receipt).
4. If **Receipt** is selected, you can optionally upload a receipt image.
5. Enter the amount.
6. Confirm the payment.

The payment status updates automatically based on the remaining balance.

## Accepting Storefront Receipt Payments

When a customer places an order through your online storefront and selects **Receipt** as the payment method, the order is created with a **pending** payment record. The customer uploads a receipt image as proof of payment during checkout.

To accept the payment:

1. Open the order details. You will see the **Accept Payment Receipt** button in the header (instead of the usual "Add Payment" button).
2. Click **Accept Payment Receipt**.
3. A confirmation dialog opens showing the **receipt image** uploaded by the customer.
4. Review the receipt to verify the payment.
5. Click **Confirm** to mark the payment as **Completed**.

<Callout title="Note">
The "Accept Payment Receipt" button only appears for storefront orders with Receipt payment method that have a pending payment. For other orders, the regular "Add Payment" button is shown.
</Callout>

## Accepting Storefront Cash Payments

When a customer places a storefront order with **Cash** payment, a pending payment record is created. After the customer pays on delivery or pickup:

1. Open the order details.
2. Click **Add Payment** (or use the order actions to mark the payment as complete).
3. The payment is recorded and the order payment status updates.

## Cancelling an Order

1. Open the order details.
2. Click **Cancel** from the actions menu.
3. Confirm the cancellation.

<Callout title="Note">
Cancelling an order reverses inventory changes if inventory tracking was enabled. The stock levels return to what they were before the order.
</Callout>

## Printing a Receipt

1. Open the order details.
2. Click **Print Receipt**.
3. The receipt opens in a print dialog formatted according to your [Receipt Settings](/docs/stores/receipt-settings).
