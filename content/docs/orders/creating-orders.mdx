## How to Create an Order

1. Go to **Sales > Create Order** in the sidebar, or click **Create Order** from the Dashboard quick actions.
2. The order creation screen opens in full-screen mode with two panels.

### Left Panel — Order Details

This is where you configure the order:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Store** | Select which store this order belongs to (if you have multiple stores) |
| **Customer** | Select an existing customer or click **Add Customer** to create a new one |
| **Fulfillment Method** | Choose: In-Store, Pickup, Delivery, or Dine-In |
| **Delivery Address** | Required if fulfillment is Delivery (country, city, details) |
| **Channel** | The sales channel for this order |
| **Notes** | Optional notes about the order |

### Right Panel — Product Selection

This is where you select products to add to the order:

1. **Browse by category** — Click category tabs to filter products.
2. **Search** — Use the search bar to find products by name.
3. **Click a product** to add it to the order. If the product has multiple variants, you will be asked to select one.
4. **Custom Item** — Click **Add Custom Item** to add an item that is not in your inventory:
   - Enter a custom name and description
   - Set the price and quantity
   - Custom items are useful for services, special requests, or items you do not regularly stock
   - Custom items do not affect inventory levels

### Cart Section

As you add products, they appear in the cart (order items list):

- **Adjust quantity** — Click + or - to change the quantity.
- **Remove item** — Click the remove button to delete an item.
- Each line shows the product name, variant, quantity, and price.

### Order Summary

Below the cart, you will see the order calculation:

| Line | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Subtotal** | Sum of all item prices |
| **[Service Fee](/docs/stores/service-fees)** | Automatically added if configured (can be edited) |
| **[Delivery Fee](/docs/stores/delivery-zones)** | Automatically added for delivery orders (can be edited) |
| **Discount** | Click to apply a manual discount (fixed amount or percentage) |
| **Tax** | Calculated automatically based on tax settings |
| **Total** | The final amount the customer owes |

## Applying a Discount

1. Click the **Discount** button in the order summary.
2. Choose the discount type:
   - **Fixed Amount** — A specific amount off the total (e.g., 50 EGP off)
   - **Percentage** — A percentage off the subtotal (e.g., 10% off)
3. Enter the discount value.
4. The order total updates automatically.

## Processing Payment (Checkout)

1. Click **Checkout** when the order is ready.
2. A payment dialog opens.

### Store Credit

If the selected customer has a store credit balance:

- A **Use Store Credit** toggle appears at the top of the payment section.
- Enable it to apply the customer's credit toward the order.
- The system shows how much credit will be used and the remaining amount to pay.
- If the credit fully covers the order, no additional payment method is needed.

### Payment Method Selection

Select the payment method for the remaining amount:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cash** | Physical cash payment. Enter the amount received and the system calculates change. |
| **Online** | Digital payment (card, InstaPay, mobile wallet, bank transfer, etc.). |
| **Receipt** | Transfer payment with optional receipt image upload. |

<Callout title="Note">
Only payment methods **enabled** for your store appear in this list. See [Payment Methods](/docs/stores/payment-methods) to configure them.
</Callout>

### Receipt Upload

When you select **Receipt** as the payment method:

1. An upload section appears below the payment method selector.
2. Click **Choose File** to upload a photo of the payment receipt (JPEG, PNG, or WebP).
3. The file uploads automatically and attaches to the payment record.
4. Uploading is optional — you can create the order without uploading a receipt image.

### Cash Payment with Change

If the customer pays with cash and gives more than the total:

- The system shows the **change amount** to give back.
- Example: Order total is 150 EGP, customer pays 200 EGP, change is 50 EGP.

### Scheduling Remaining Payment

For orders with partial payments, you can schedule the remaining balance:

1. Enable the **Schedule Remaining Payment** checkbox.
2. Set the **due date** for the remaining balance.
3. The remaining amount becomes a scheduled pending payment.
4. Track scheduled payments in the [Overdue Payments](/docs/orders/overdue-payments) section.

<Callout title="Note">
Scheduled payments help you manage customer credit and track outstanding balances. Make sure to follow up on due payments to maintain healthy cash flow.

## After Order Creation

Once the order is created:

- A **success dialog** appears with receipt options (see [Receipt Options](#receipt-options) below).
- The order appears in the **Sales** list with its order number.
- **Order source** is automatically recorded as **Web** (portal) for tracking and analytics.
- Inventory is automatically adjusted (if inventory tracking is enabled).

### Receipt Options

After creating an order, you have several options for providing the receipt to the customer:

- **Print Receipt** — Print a physical receipt using your receipt printer
- **Download PDF** — Download the receipt as a PDF file to email or share
- **Share Link** — Generate a shareable link that the customer can access to view or download the receipt
- **QR Code** — Display a QR code that customers can scan to access their receipt

<Callout title="Tip">
Receipt links and QR codes are especially useful for delivery orders or when customers prefer digital receipts. The link remains accessible for future reference.
