   - Set the price and quantity
   - Custom items are useful for services, special requests, or items you don't regularly stock

### Cart Section

As you add products, they appear in the cart (order items list):

- **Adjust quantity** — Click + or - to change the quantity.
- **Remove item** — Click the remove button to delete an item.
- Each line shows the product name, variant, quantity, and price.

### Order Summary

Below the cart, you will see the order calculation:

## Applying a Discount

1. Click the **Discount** button in the order summary.
2. Choose the discount type:
   - **Fixed Amount** — A specific amount off the total (e.g., 50 EGP off)
   - **Percentage** — A percentage off the subtotal (e.g., 10% off)
3. Enter the discount value.
4. The order total updates automatically.

## Processing Payment (Checkout)

1. Click **Checkout** when the order is ready.
2. A payment dialog opens.
3. Select the **payment method**:
   - **Cash** — Physical cash payment
   - **Card** — Credit or debit card payment
   - **InstaPay** — InstaPay payment
   - **Mobile Wallet** — Mobile wallet payment (e.g., Vodafone Cash, Orange Money)
   - **Bank Transfer** — Bank transfer payment
   - **Store Credit** — Use the customer's store credit balance (only available if a customer is selected and has credit)

4. Enter the **amount paid**.
5. Payment options:
   - **Full payment** — Pay the entire amount at once.
   - **Partial payment** — Pay part now and schedule the rest (see [Scheduled Payments](#scheduled-payments) below).
   - **Skip payment** — Create the order with a pending payment status.
6. Click **Confirm** to complete the order.

### Store Credit Payment

When a customer is selected and has a store credit balance:

- **Store Credit** appears as a payment method option
- The available credit amount is shown
- You can use all or part of the credit
- If the credit doesn't cover the full order, you can combine it with another payment method
- The credit is automatically deducted from the customer's balance

### Cash Payment with Change

If the customer pays with cash and gives more than the total:

- The system shows the **change amount** to give back.
- Example: Order total is 150 EGP, customer pays 200 EGP → Change is 50 EGP.

### Scheduled Payments

For orders with partial payments, you can schedule the remaining balance:

1. Select **Partial payment** during checkout.
2. Enter the amount being paid now.
3. Set the **due date** for the remaining balance.
4. The order is created with a payment status showing the paid amount and outstanding balance.
5. You can track scheduled payments in the [Overdue Payments](/docs/orders/overdue-payments) section.

<Callout title="Note">
Scheduled payments help you manage customer credit and track outstanding balances. Make sure to follow up on due payments to maintain healthy cash flow.

## After Order Creation

Once the order is created:

- A **success dialog** appears with receipt options (see [Receipt Options](#receipt-options) below).
- The order appears in the **Sales** list with its order number.
- **Order source** is automatically recorded (POS, Portal, Mobile, or API) for tracking and analytics.
- Inventory is automatically adjusted (if inventory tracking is enabled).

### Receipt Options

After creating an order, you have several options for providing the receipt to the customer:

- **Print Receipt** — Print a physical receipt using your receipt printer
- **Download PDF** — Download the receipt as a PDF file to email or share
- **Share Link** — Generate a shareable link that the customer can access to view or download the receipt
- **QR Code** — Display a QR code that customers can scan to access their receipt

<Callout title="Tip">
Receipt links and QR codes are especially useful for delivery orders or when customers prefer digital receipts. The link remains accessible for future reference.
