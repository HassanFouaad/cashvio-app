### Left Panel — Order Details

This is where you configure the order:

### Right Panel — Product Selection

This is where you select products to add to the order:

1. **Browse by category** — Click category tabs to filter products.
2. **Search** — Use the search bar to find products by name.
3. **Click a product** to add it to the order. If the product has multiple variants, you will be asked to select one.
4. **Custom Item** — Click **Add Custom Item** to add a non-inventory item with a custom name and price.

### Cart Section

As you add products, they appear in the cart (order items list):

- **Adjust quantity** — Click + or - to change the quantity.
- **Remove item** — Click the remove button to delete an item.
- Each line shows the product name, variant, quantity, and price.

### Order Summary

Below the cart, you will see the order calculation:

| Line | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Subtotal** | Sum of all item prices |
| **[Service Fee](/docs/stores/service-fees)** | Automatically added if configured (can be edited) |
| **[Delivery Fee](/docs/stores/delivery-zones)** | Automatically added for delivery orders (can be edited) |
| **Discount** | Click to apply a manual discount (fixed amount or percentage) |
| **Tax** | Calculated automatically based on tax settings |
| **Total** | The final amount the customer owes |

## Applying a Discount

1. Click the **Discount** button in the order summary.
2. Choose the discount type:
   - **Fixed Amount** — A specific amount off the total (e.g., 50 EGP off)
   - **Percentage** — A percentage off the subtotal (e.g., 10% off)
3. Enter the discount value.
4. The order total updates automatically.

## Processing Payment (Checkout)

1. Click **Checkout** when the order is ready.
2. A payment dialog opens.
3. Select the **payment method** (Cash, Card, InstaPay, Mobile Wallet, Bank Transfer, Store Credit).
4. Enter the **amount paid**.
5. Options:
   - **Full payment** — Pay the entire amount at once.
   - **Partial payment** — Pay part now and schedule the rest.
   - **Skip payment** — Create the order with a pending payment status.
6. Click **Confirm** to complete the order.

### Cash Payment with Change

If the customer pays with cash and gives more than the total:

- The system shows the **change amount** to give back.
- Example: Order total is 150 EGP, customer pays 200 EGP → Change is 50 EGP.

## After Order Creation

Once the order is created:

- A **success dialog** appears with the option to **print a receipt**.
- The order appears in the **Sales** list with its order number.
- Inventory is automatically adjusted (if inventory tracking is enabled).
