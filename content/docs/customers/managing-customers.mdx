You can create orders with or without attaching a customer — customers are optional but recommended.

| **Phone Number** | Customer's phone number |
| **Address** | Customer's address (optional) |
| **Date of Birth** | Optional, for loyalty or marketing |
| **Notes** | Optional notes about the customer |

4. Click **Save**.

You can also add a customer directly from the **Create Order** screen by clicking **Add Customer**.
