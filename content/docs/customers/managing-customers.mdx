## What is a Customer?

A **customer** in Cashvio is a person who buys from your store. Keeping customer records helps you track purchase history, manage store credit, and provide better service.

You can create orders with or without attaching a customer — customers are optional but recommended.

## Adding a Customer

1. Go to **Customers** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Add Customer**.
3. Fill in the customer details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **First Name** | Customer's first name |
| **Last Name** | Customer's last name |
| **Email** | Customer's email address (optional) |
| **Phone Number** | Customer's phone number |
| **Date of Birth** | Optional, for birthday rewards and marketing |
| **Notes** | Private notes about customer preferences, allergies, or special instructions |

4. Click **Save**.

You can also add a customer directly from the **Create Order** screen by clicking **Add Customer**.

Customer addresses are managed separately after creating the customer. See the [Customer Addresses](#customer-addresses) section below.
