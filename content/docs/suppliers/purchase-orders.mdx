## What is a Purchase Order?

A **purchase order** (PO) is a formal request to buy products from a supplier. It specifies what products you need, the quantities, and the expected prices. When the supplier delivers the products, you "receive" the PO in Cashvio, and your inventory is updated automatically.

## Creating a Purchase Order

1. Go to **Purchase Orders** in the sidebar, or click **Create Purchase Order** from the Dashboard.
2. Click **Create Purchase Order**.
3. Follow the multi-step wizard:

### Step 1: Store & Items
- Select the **store** the stock is for.
- Add products from your catalogue with quantities and agreed prices.

### Step 2: Basic Information
- Select the **supplier**.
- Set the **expected delivery date**.

### Step 3: Fees & Details
- Add any additional **delivery fees** or charges.
- Add any **notes**.

### Step 4: Review
- Review all the details before submitting.
- Click **Submit** to create the purchase order.

## Purchase Order Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Draft** | PO created but not yet sent to the supplier |
| **Pending** | PO sent to the supplier, waiting for approval |
| **Approved** | PO approved, waiting for delivery |
| **Received** | Products received and stock updated |
| **Cancelled** | PO was cancelled |

## Receiving Stock from a Purchase Order

When products arrive from a supplier:

1. Open the purchase order details.
2. Click **Receive Stock**.
3. Confirm the quantities received.
4. Click **Confirm**.

The inventory for the selected store is automatically updated with the received quantities.

## Managing Purchase Orders

The **Purchase Orders** page shows all POs with filters:

- **PO Number** — Search by PO number
- **Store** — Filter by store
- **Supplier** — Filter by supplier
- **Status** — Filter by PO status
- **Date Range** — Filter by date

## How Purchase Orders Affect the System

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **PO Created** | No inventory change — it is just a record of intent |
| **PO Received** | Inventory increases by the received quantities |
| **PO Cancelled** | No inventory change — the order is voided |

Use the [Low Stock](/docs/inventory/stock-management) alerts in the Inventory section to identify which products need restocking, then create a Purchase Order to order them from the appropriate [supplier](/docs/suppliers/managing-suppliers).
