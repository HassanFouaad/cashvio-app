## What is TikTok Pixel?

**TikTok Pixel** is a tracking tool from TikTok that helps you measure the effectiveness of your TikTok advertising. When installed on your online store, it tracks actions customers take — like viewing products, adding items to cart, and completing purchases.

This data helps you:
- **Measure ad performance** — See how many conversions your TikTok ads generate
- **Build audiences** — Create custom and lookalike audiences for TikTok ads
- **Optimize delivery** — Let TikTok show your ads to people most likely to convert
- **Retarget visitors** — Show ads to people who visited your store but didn't purchase

## How to Set Up TikTok Pixel

1. **Get your Pixel ID** from TikTok Ads Manager:
   - Go to [ads.tiktok.com](https://ads.tiktok.com)
   - Navigate to **Assets > Events** and click **Manage** under Web Events
   - Click **Set Up Web Events** and select **TikTok Pixel**
   - Name your Pixel and select **Manually Install Pixel Code**
   - Copy your **Pixel ID** (an alphanumeric code, typically starting with `C`)

2. **Enter the Pixel ID in Cashvio:**
   - Go to your store's settings in the tenant portal
   - Navigate to the **Online Store** configuration
   - Find the **TikTok Pixel** tab
   - Paste your Pixel ID
   - Click **Save**

## What Events are Tracked

Once configured, the following events are automatically tracked on your online storefront:

| Event | When it fires |
|-------|---------------|
| **Page View** | Customer visits any page |
| **ViewContent** | Customer views a product detail page |
| **AddToCart** | Customer adds a product to their cart |
| **InitiateCheckout** | Customer starts the checkout process |
| **CompletePayment** | Customer completes an order |
| **Search** | Customer searches for products |

## Verifying the Setup

To verify your Pixel is working:
1. Install the **TikTok Pixel Helper** Chrome extension.
2. Visit your online store.
3. The extension shows which events are firing and whether data is being sent correctly.

## Using TikTok Pixel with Media Buying

TikTok Pixel is essential for media buyers running TikTok ad campaigns. With the pixel installed:

- **Create Custom Audiences** based on store visitors, cart abandoners, or past purchasers
- **Build Lookalike Audiences** to find new customers similar to your best buyers
- **Optimize for Conversions** by letting TikTok's algorithm target users most likely to purchase
- **Track ROAS** (Return on Ad Spend) accurately across your campaigns

<Callout title="Note">
TikTok Pixel only works on your **online storefront**. It does not track actions in the tenant portal (admin dashboard). The Pixel is loaded per store — each store can have its own TikTok Pixel ID.

<Callout title="Tip">
For best results, use TikTok Pixel alongside **Facebook Pixel** and **Google Tag Manager**. Each platform serves different audiences, and having all three installed gives you maximum reach and tracking coverage for your ad campaigns.
