## What is Google Tag Manager?

**Google Tag Manager (GTM)** is a free tool from Google that lets you manage tracking codes (tags) on your website without editing code. Through GTM, you can set up **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** tracking, conversion tracking, and other marketing tags.

## How to Set Up GTM

1. **Create a GTM container** at [tagmanager.google.com](https://tagmanager.google.com):
   - Create an account and container for your website
   - Copy your **GTM Container ID** (looks like `GTM-XXXXXXX`)

2. **Enter the GTM ID in Cashvio:**
   - Go to your store's settings in the business portal
   - Navigate to the **Online Store** configuration
   - Find the **Google Tag Manager ID** field
   - Paste your GTM Container ID
   - Click **Save**

## What You Can Track

With GTM connected, you can set up tracking for:

| Tracking | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Page Views** | Track which pages customers visit |
| **Product Views** | Track which products customers look at |
| **Add to Cart** | Track when products are added to cart |
| **Checkout** | Track checkout initiation |
| **Purchases** | Track completed orders with revenue data |
| **Custom Events** | Set up any additional tracking you need |

## Enhanced E-commerce Tracking

Cashvio's storefront supports **enhanced e-commerce** data, providing detailed information about:

- Product impressions (product list views)
- Product clicks
- Product detail views
- Add to cart actions
- Checkout steps
- Purchase transactions with item-level data

## Connecting Google Analytics 4

To use GA4 with your GTM:

1. In GTM, create a **GA4 Configuration** tag with your GA4 Measurement ID.
2. Set it to fire on **All Pages**.
3. Create additional GA4 Event tags for e-commerce events.
4. Publish your GTM container.
