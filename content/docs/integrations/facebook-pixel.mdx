## What is Facebook Pixel?

**Facebook Pixel** is a tracking tool from Meta (Facebook) that helps you measure the effectiveness of your advertising. When installed on your online store, it tracks actions customers take — like viewing products, adding items to cart, and completing purchases.

This data helps you:
- **Measure ad performance** — See how many conversions your ads generate
- **Build audiences** — Create targeted audiences for Facebook and Instagram ads
- **Optimize delivery** — Let Facebook show your ads to people most likely to buy

## How to Set Up Facebook Pixel

1. **Get your Pixel ID** from your Facebook Business Manager:
   - Go to [business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com)
   - Navigate to **Events Manager > Pixels**
   - Copy your **Pixel ID** (a number like `1234567890123456`)

2. **Enter the Pixel ID in Cashvio:**
   - Go to your store's settings in the business portal
   - Navigate to the **Online Store** configuration
   - Find the **Facebook Pixel ID** field
   - Paste your Pixel ID
   - Click **Save**

## What Events are Tracked

Once configured, the following events are automatically tracked on your online storefront:

| Event | When it fires |
|-------|---------------|
| **PageView** | Customer visits any page |
| **ViewContent** | Customer views a product detail page |
| **AddToCart** | Customer adds a product to their cart |
| **InitiateCheckout** | Customer starts the checkout process |
| **Purchase** | Customer completes an order |

## Verifying the Setup

To verify your Pixel is working:
1. Install the **Meta Pixel Helper** Chrome extension.
2. Visit your online store.
3. The extension shows which events are firing.

## Using Facebook Pixel with Media Buying

Facebook Pixel is essential for media buyers running Meta ad campaigns (Facebook & Instagram). With the pixel installed:

- **Create Custom Audiences** based on store visitors, cart abandoners, or past purchasers
- **Build Lookalike Audiences** to find new customers similar to your best buyers
- **Optimize for Conversions** by letting Meta's algorithm target users most likely to purchase
- **Track ROAS** (Return on Ad Spend) accurately across your campaigns
- **Retarget visitors** who browsed products but didn't complete checkout

<Callout title="Note">
Facebook Pixel only works on your **online storefront**. It does not track actions in the business portal (admin dashboard). The Pixel is loaded per store — each store can have its own Pixel ID.

<Callout title="Tip">
For best results, use Facebook Pixel alongside **TikTok Pixel** and **Google Tag Manager**. Each platform serves different audiences, and having all three installed gives you maximum reach and tracking coverage for your ad campaigns.
