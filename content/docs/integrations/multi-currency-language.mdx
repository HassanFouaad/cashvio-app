## Multi-Currency Support

### How Currency Works in Cashvio

Each **store** in Cashvio has its own **currency** setting. This means:

- All product prices in that store are displayed in the store's currency
- All order totals, payments, and reports use the store's currency
- The currency symbol and formatting follow the locale (e.g., "200 EGP" for Egyptian Pounds, "$200" for US Dollars)

### Setting a Store's Currency

When creating a store, you select its currency. This is set during store creation and **cannot be changed** afterwards.

### Multiple Currencies Across Stores

If you operate stores in different countries, each store can have a different currency:

| Store | Currency |
|-------|----------|
| Cairo Branch | EGP (Egyptian Pound) |
| Dubai Branch | AED (UAE Dirham) |
| Online Store US | USD (US Dollar) |

Reports can show data per store (in its own currency) or aggregated across stores.

### Currency Display on the Online Store

Your online storefront displays prices in the **store's currency** with proper locale-aware formatting:

- **English (EGP):** EGP 200.00
- **Arabic (EGP):** ٢٠٠٫٠٠ ج.م

The formatting adapts to the customer's selected language.

## Multi-Language Support

### Tenant Portal Languages

The Cashvio admin portal supports:

- **English** — Full interface in English
- **Arabic (العربية)** — Full interface in Arabic with RTL layout

Each team member can choose their preferred language independently.

### Online Storefront Languages

Your online store also supports both languages:

- **English** — All store content, navigation, and checkout in English
- **Arabic** — Full RTL support with Arabic translations

Customers can switch languages using the **language selector** in the store header.

### What Gets Translated

| Content | Translated? |
|---------|-------------|
| **UI labels** (buttons, menus, headings) | Yes — automatically via the translation system |
| **Product names and descriptions** | No — displayed as you enter them in the portal |
| **Category names** | No — displayed as entered |
| **Policy pages** | No — you provide the content in the language you choose |

<Callout title="Tip">
If you want your products to appear in both English and Arabic on the storefront, enter the product names and descriptions in both languages in the portal, or choose one primary language for your product content.
</Callout>

### RTL (Right-to-Left) Support

When Arabic is selected:

- The entire layout flips to **right-to-left**
- Text alignment changes
- Navigation moves to the right side
- Numbers and currency remain in their standard format

Both the tenant portal and the storefront fully support RTL.
