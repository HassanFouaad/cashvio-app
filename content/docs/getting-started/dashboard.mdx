## What is the Dashboard?

The **Dashboard** is the first screen you see after logging in. It gives you a quick overview of your business performance and provides shortcuts to the most common actions.

Your Dashboard address is the root URL of your Cashvio portal — simply log in and you are there.

## Sales Overview Cards

At the top of the Dashboard, you will see **sales overview cards** showing your current month's performance:

| Card | What it shows |
|------|--------------|
| **Total Sales** | The sum of payments received from completed orders this month |
| **Orders Count** | The number of orders created this month |
| **Average Order Value** | Total sales divided by the number of orders |

These numbers update automatically as new orders are placed and payments are received.

## Top Products Chart

Below the sales cards, you will see a **visual chart** showing your best-selling products. This chart ranks products by revenue or quantity sold, helping you quickly identify what is selling well.

## Quick Actions

The Dashboard provides a grid of **quick action cards**, organized by module. Each card is a shortcut to a common task:

| Module | Actions |
|--------|---------|
| **Orders** | Create Order, View Orders |
| **Returns** | Create Return, View Returns |
| **Customers** | Add Customer, View Customers |
| **Products** | Add Product, View Products |
| **Categories** | Add Category, View Categories |
| **Options** | Manage Options |
| **Inventory** | Manage Inventory, Low Stock, Adjustments, Transfers |
| **Suppliers** | Add Supplier, View Suppliers |
| **Purchase Orders** | Create Purchase Order, View Purchase Orders |
| **Users** | Invite User, View Users |
| **Roles** | Create Role, View Roles |
| **Stores** | Add Store, View Stores |
| **Reports** | View Reports |
| **Settings** | Open Settings |

<Callout title="Important">
The Dashboard adapts based on your **permissions**. You will only see quick actions for features you are allowed to access. If your role does not include access to inventory, for example, the inventory quick actions will not appear.

## Sidebar Navigation

On the left side of the screen (or the right side in Arabic), you will find the **sidebar navigation**. This is the main way to move between sections of Cashvio:

- **Dashboard** — Return to the main overview
- **Sales** — All Sales, Create Order, Overdue Payments, Returns
- **Catalogue** — Categories, Products, Options
- **Inventory** — All Inventory, Low Stock, Adjustments
- **Customers** — Customer list and profiles
- **Suppliers** — All Suppliers, Add Supplier
- **Purchase Orders** — Manage purchase orders
- **Channels** — Sales channels
- **Reports** — Analytics and reports
- **Roles & Permissions** — Manage roles
- **Users** — Manage team members
- **Settings** — All settings

On **mobile devices**, the sidebar converts to a **bottom navigation bar** with the most important items. Tap **More** to see additional navigation options.

## Switching Between Dark and Light Mode

Cashvio supports both **dark mode** and **light mode**. To switch:

1. Click on your **profile icon** at the top of the screen.
2. Find the **theme toggle**.
3. Select **Light Mode** or **Dark Mode**.

The interface will update immediately.
