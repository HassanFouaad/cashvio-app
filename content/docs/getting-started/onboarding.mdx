## What is the Onboarding?

When you log in for the first time, Cashvio shows you a **guided onboarding** process. This is a checklist of essential steps to get your business up and running. You will see a welcome message: **"Welcome! Let's set up your store"**.

The onboarding widget appears at the top of your Dashboard and tracks your progress. Once you complete all steps, it disappears and your Dashboard shows the full sales overview.

## Onboarding Steps

The onboarding walks you through these key tasks:

### 1. Create Your First Store

Every business in Cashvio needs at least one store. A store represents a physical location or an online shop.

- Click on **Add Store** in the onboarding checklist.
- Fill in your store details (name, address, currency, tax settings).
- Click **Save**.

See [Stores](/docs/stores/creating-store) for detailed instructions.

### 2. Add Your First Product

Products are what you sell. You need at least one product to start processing orders.

- Click on **Add Product** in the onboarding checklist.
- Fill in the product name, price, and category.
- Click **Save**.

See [Products](/docs/catalogue/products) for detailed instructions.

### 3. Add Your First Category

Categories help organize your products (for example: "Electronics", "Clothing", "Food").

- Click on **Add Category** in the onboarding checklist.
- Enter a category name and optional description.
- Click **Save**.

See [Categories](/docs/catalogue/categories) for detailed instructions.

### 4. Create Your First Order

Once you have a product, you can create a test order to see how the sales flow works.

- Click on **Create Order** in the onboarding checklist.
- Select a product, choose a payment method, and complete the order.

See [Creating Orders](/docs/orders/creating-orders) for detailed instructions.

## Skipping the Onboarding

You can use Cashvio without completing the onboarding. The onboarding widget stays visible until you finish all steps, but you can access all features at any time from the sidebar navigation.
