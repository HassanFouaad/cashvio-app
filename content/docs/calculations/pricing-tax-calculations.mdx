## How Order Totals are Calculated

Every order in Cashvio follows this calculation flow:

```
Subtotal = Sum of (item price × quantity) for all items
+ Service Fee (if applicable)
+ Delivery Fee (if applicable)
- Discount (if applied)
+ Tax
= Order Total
```

## Subtotal

The **subtotal** is the sum of all items in the order before any fees, discounts, or tax:

**Subtotal = Item 1 Price × Qty + Item 2 Price × Qty + ...**

Example:
| Item | Price | Qty | Line Total |
|------|-------|-----|------------|
| T-shirt (M/Blue) | 150 EGP | 2 | 300 EGP |
| Jeans (L) | 350 EGP | 1 | 350 EGP |
| **Subtotal** | | | **650 EGP** |

## Tax Calculation

Tax is calculated based on the **tax rate** set for each product:

### Tax Exclusive (Price does NOT include tax)
If the product price **does not** include tax:
- **Tax = Subtotal × Tax Rate**
- **Total = Subtotal + Tax**

Example: Product price is 100 EGP, tax rate is 14%
- Tax = 100 × 0.14 = **14 EGP**
- Total = 100 + 14 = **114 EGP**

### Tax Inclusive (Price includes tax)
If the product price **already includes** tax:
- **Price before tax = Price ÷ (1 + Tax Rate)**
- **Tax = Price - Price before tax**

Example: Product price is 114 EGP (tax included), tax rate is 14%
- Price before tax = 114 ÷ 1.14 = **100 EGP**
- Tax = 114 - 100 = **14 EGP**

<Callout title="Important">
The **Tax Included** toggle on each product controls how tax is calculated. Make sure this is set correctly to avoid pricing errors.

## Discounts

Discounts can be applied manually when creating an order:

### Fixed Discount
A specific amount subtracted from the subtotal.

Example: 50 EGP discount on a 650 EGP subtotal
- Discounted subtotal = 650 - 50 = **600 EGP**
- Tax is then calculated on 600 EGP

### Percentage Discount
A percentage of the subtotal.

Example: 10% discount on a 650 EGP subtotal
- Discount = 650 × 0.10 = 65 EGP
- Discounted subtotal = 650 - 65 = **585 EGP**
- Tax is then calculated on 585 EGP

## Service Fees

Service fees are added after the subtotal:

### Fixed Service Fee
A fixed amount (e.g., 20 EGP service fee).

### Percentage Service Fee
A percentage of the subtotal (e.g., 10% of subtotal).

Service fees are **subject to tax** — tax is calculated on the subtotal plus service fee.

## Delivery Fees

Delivery fees are determined by the **delivery zone** matching the customer's address. They are a fixed amount added to the order.

Delivery fees are typically **not subject to tax** (they appear as a separate line item).

## Full Calculation Example

| Line | Calculation | Amount |
|------|-------------|--------|
| T-shirt × 2 | 150 × 2 | 300 EGP |
| Jeans × 1 | 350 × 1 | 350 EGP |
| **Subtotal** | | **650 EGP** |
| Discount (10%) | 650 × 0.10 | -65 EGP |
| **After Discount** | | **585 EGP** |
| Service Fee (10%) | 585 × 0.10 | 58.50 EGP |
| **Taxable Amount** | | **643.50 EGP** |
| Tax (14%) | 643.50 × 0.14 | 90.09 EGP |
| Delivery Fee | Fixed | 30 EGP |
| **Order Total** | | **763.59 EGP** |

## Profit Calculations

Profit is calculated using the **cost price** vs. **selling price** of each product:

**Gross Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price**

**Profit Margin = (Gross Profit ÷ Selling Price) × 100%**

Example:
- Selling price: 150 EGP
- Cost price: 80 EGP
- Gross profit: 70 EGP
- Profit margin: 46.7%

These calculations appear in the **Profit Report** under Reports.

<Callout title="Tip">
Always keep your product cost prices up to date. This ensures accurate profit reporting and helps you make informed pricing decisions.
