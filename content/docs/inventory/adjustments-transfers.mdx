## Stock Adjustments

Sometimes you need to change stock levels manually — for example, after a physical count, when items are damaged, or to correct an error.

### How to Adjust Stock

1. Go to **Inventory** in the sidebar.
2. Find the product variant you want to adjust.
3. Click the **actions menu** (three dots) on the item.
4. Choose the adjustment type:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Increase Stock** | Add stock (e.g., found extra items, correction) |
| **Decrease Stock** | Remove stock (e.g., correction, shrinkage) |
| **Consume / Damaged** | Record items consumed or damaged (removed from stock) |

5. Enter the **quantity** and an optional **reason/note**.
6. Click **Confirm**.

The stock level updates immediately.

## Viewing Adjustment History

Go to **Inventory > Adjustments** in the sidebar to see a history of all stock changes:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Product / Variant** | Which item was adjusted |
| **Type** | The type of adjustment |
| **Quantity** | How much the stock changed (+ or -) |
| **Reason** | Why the adjustment was made |
| **Date** | When the adjustment was made |
| **User** | Who made the adjustment |

This history provides a complete audit trail of all inventory changes.

## Stock Transfers

If you operate multiple stores, you can transfer inventory from one store to another.

### How to Transfer Stock

1. Go to **Inventory** in the sidebar.
2. Find the product variant you want to transfer.
3. Click the **actions menu** and select **Transfer**.
4. Fill in:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Source Store** | The store sending the stock |
| **Destination Store** | The store receiving the stock |
| **Quantity** | How many units to transfer |
| **Notes** | Optional reason for the transfer |

5. Click **Confirm**.

The stock is deducted from the source store and added to the destination store instantly.
