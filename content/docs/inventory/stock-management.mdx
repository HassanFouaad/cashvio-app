## How Inventory Works

Cashvio tracks inventory **per product variant, per store**. This means if you sell a T-shirt in sizes S, M, and L across two stores, each size in each store has its own stock count.

Inventory tracking is **optional per product**. Products with inventory tracking disabled are treated as always in stock.

## Viewing Inventory

1. Go to **Inventory > All Inventory** in the sidebar.
2. If you have multiple stores, **select a store** to view its inventory.
3. You will see a table showing:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Product / Variant** | The product name and variant details |
| **SKU** | Stock keeping unit code |
| **Current Stock** | How many units are available |
| **Reorder Point** | The stock level that triggers a low stock alert |
| **Status** | In Stock, Low Stock, or Out of Stock |

## Stock Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **In Stock** | Stock is above the reorder point |
| **Low Stock** | Stock is at or below the reorder point |
| **Out of Stock** | Stock is zero |

## Low Stock Alerts

Go to **Inventory > Low Stock** in the sidebar to see only items that need restocking.

Items appear here when their current stock falls to or below the **reorder point** you set. This helps you know when to reorder from suppliers.

### Setting a Reorder Point

1. Open the inventory details for a product variant.
2. Click **Update Reorder Point**.
3. Enter the minimum stock level that should trigger an alert.
4. Click **Save**.

**Example:** If you set the reorder point for "T-shirt / M / Blue" to 10, it appears in the Low Stock list when stock drops to 10 or below.

## How Stock Changes

Stock levels change automatically based on business operations:

| Action | Effect on Stock |
|--------|----------------|
| **Order completed** | Stock decreases by the ordered quantity |
| **Order cancelled** | Stock is restored to pre-order levels |
| **Return approved** | Stock increases by the returned quantity |
| **[Purchase order](/docs/suppliers/purchase-orders) received** | Stock increases by the received quantity |
| **[Manual adjustment](/docs/inventory/adjustments-transfers)** | Stock increases or decreases based on the adjustment |
| **[Stock transfer](/docs/inventory/adjustments-transfers)** | Stock decreases in source store, increases in destination store |
| **Damaged/consumed** | Stock decreases |

<Callout title="Important">
Only products with **Track Inventory** enabled are affected by these stock changes. If a product has inventory tracking disabled, stock is not tracked.
</Callout>
