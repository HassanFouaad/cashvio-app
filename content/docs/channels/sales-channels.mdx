## What are Sales Channels?

A **sales channel** represents a source or method through which orders reach your business. Tracking channels helps you understand where your revenue comes from.

**Examples of channels:**
- In-Store (walk-in customers)
- Online Store (website orders)
- Phone Orders
- Social Media (Instagram, Facebook)
- Marketplace (third-party platforms)

## Creating a Channel

1. Go to **Channels** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Create Channel**.
3. Enter the channel details:
   - **Channel Name** — A name for this channel
   - **Channel Type** — The category of the channel
4. Assign which **stores** use this channel.
5. Click **Save**.

## Using Channels in Orders

When creating an order, you can select the **Channel** to record where the order came from. This is optional but useful for reporting.

## Viewing Channel Performance

In the **[Reports > Sales Overview](/docs/reports/analytics-reports)**, you can view the **Sales by Channel** chart to see which channels generate the most revenue.

## Managing Channels

From the **Channels** page:
- **Edit** a channel — Update its name or configuration
- **Delete** a channel — Remove a channel you no longer use
