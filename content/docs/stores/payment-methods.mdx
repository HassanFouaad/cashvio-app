## What are Payment Methods?

Payment methods define how customers can pay for their orders. Each store has two sets of payment methods:

- **Portal Payment Methods** — Used when you or your team create orders in the business portal (like a POS system).
- **Storefront Payment Methods** — Used when customers place orders through your online store.

## Available Payment Methods

Cashvio uses a unified set of payment methods:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cash** | Physical cash payment. The system calculates change automatically when creating portal orders. For storefront orders, the customer pays on delivery or pickup. |
| **Online** | Digital payment (credit/debit card, InstaPay, mobile wallet, bank transfer, etc.). |
| **Receipt** | The payer uploads a photo of the payment receipt as proof of transfer. |
| **Store Credit** | Using the customer's store credit balance. Only available in the portal when a customer is selected and has credit. |

## Configuring Portal Payment Methods

Portal payment methods control what options your team sees when creating orders in the business portal.

1. Navigate to **Store Details > Payment Methods** in the sidebar.
2. If you have multiple stores, select the store first.
3. You will see the **Portal** tab with a list of all payment methods.
4. **Enable** or **disable** each method using the toggle switch.
5. Changes save automatically after confirmation.

Only enabled portal payment methods appear as options when [creating orders](/docs/orders/creating-orders) in the business portal.

## Storefront Payment Methods

Storefront payment methods control what options customers see during online checkout. By default, **Cash** and **Receipt** are enabled for all stores.

<Callout title="Note">
Online payments are not yet available. Cash and Receipt are the currently supported storefront payment methods. When online payments become available, you will be able to enable them from the portal.

### How Each Method Works on the Storefront

| Method | Customer Experience |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Cash** | Customer selects "Cash" at checkout. A pending payment record is created. You mark it as paid from the business portal when the customer pays on delivery or pickup. |
| **Receipt** | Customer selects "Upload Receipt" and uploads a photo of their payment transfer. A pending payment is created with the receipt attached. You review and accept the receipt from the business portal. |

## Store Credit Payments

If a customer has **store credit** (balance on their account), it can be used to pay for portal orders:

- Store credit appears as an option when a customer is selected and has a balance.
- You can use all or part of the credit.
- If the credit does not cover the full order, the remaining amount can be paid with another method (split payment).
- The credit is automatically deducted from the customer's balance.

You can add store credit to a customer's account from the [Customer Details](/docs/customers/managing-customers) page.

## Split Payments

Cashvio supports **split payments** on a single order. A customer can pay part of an order with store credit and the remainder with cash or another method.

When processing a split payment in the portal:

1. During checkout, enable the **Use Store Credit** toggle.
2. The system shows how much store credit will be applied.
3. The remaining amount is paid with the selected payment method.
4. Both payment records are tracked separately.

## Scheduling Payments

For orders that are not paid in full immediately, you can **schedule the remaining payment**:

1. During checkout, enable **Schedule Remaining Payment**.
2. Set the **due date** for the remaining balance.
3. The order is created with a pending scheduled payment.
4. The order appears in the **Overdue Payments** section if not paid by the due date.

See [Overdue Payments](/docs/orders/overdue-payments) for more details.

## Receipt Upload (Portal)

When the **Receipt** payment method is selected in the portal during order creation or when adding a payment:

1. An upload section appears below the payment method selector.
2. Click **Choose File** to upload a photo of the receipt (JPEG, PNG, or WebP).
3. The receipt is uploaded and attached to the payment record.
4. This is optional — you can create a receipt payment without uploading the image.

<Callout title="Tip">
Receipt uploads are useful for tracking transfer payments. The receipt image can be viewed later from the order details page.
