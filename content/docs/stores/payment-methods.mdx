## What are Payment Methods?

Payment methods define how customers can pay for their orders. Each store can have its own set of accepted payment methods. When creating an order, the cashier or customer selects from the available methods.

## Available Payment Methods

Cashvio supports the following payment methods:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cash** | Physical cash payment. The system calculates change automatically. |
| **Card** | Credit or debit card payment. |
| **InstaPay** | Payment via InstaPay transfer. |
| **Mobile Wallet** | Payment via mobile wallets (e.g., Vodafone Cash). |
| **Bank Transfer** | Direct bank transfer payment. |
| **Store Credit** | Using the customer's store credit balance. |

## How to Configure Payment Methods

1. Click **Payment Methods** in the sidebar. If you have multiple stores, you will be asked to select a store first.
2. You will see a list of all available payment methods.
3. **Enable** or **disable** each method using the toggle switch.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

## Mixed Payments

Cashvio supports **mixed payment methods** on a single order. This means a customer can pay part of an order with cash and the remaining amount with a card, for example.

When processing a mixed payment:

1. During checkout, select the first payment method and enter the amount.
2. Add additional payment methods for the remaining balance.
3. The system tracks each payment separately.

## Store Credit Payments

If a customer has **store credit** (balance on their account), they can use it to pay for orders:

- Store credit is applied first, then the remaining amount can be paid with another method.
- You can add store credit to a customer's account from the [Customer Details](/docs/customers/managing-customers) page.

## Scheduling Payments

For orders that are not paid in full immediately, you can **schedule the remaining payment**:

1. During checkout, complete the partial payment.
2. The remaining amount becomes a **pending payment**.
3. The order appears in the **Overdue Payments** section if not paid by the due date.

See [Overdue Payments](/docs/orders/overdue-payments) for more details.
