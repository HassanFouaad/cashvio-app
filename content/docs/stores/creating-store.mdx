## What is a Store?

A **store** in Cashvio represents a business location where you sell products. This can be a physical shop, a warehouse, an online store, or any point of sale. Each store has its own:

- **Currency** — The currency used for pricing and transactions
- **Tax settings** — How taxes are calculated
- **Payment methods** — Which payment methods are accepted
- **Fulfillment methods** — How orders are delivered or picked up
- **Inventory** — Stock levels tracked separately per store

When you sign up for Cashvio, your first store is **automatically created** during the onboarding process. If your plan supports multiple stores, you can add more later.

## Viewing Your Store

To see your store details:

1. Go to **Settings** in the sidebar.
2. Under **Store Details**, click to open your store's detail page.
3. You will see a page with **action cards** linking to each store configuration area:

| Action Card | What it configures |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Store Settings** | Basic store information (name, address, currency, tax) |
| **[Payment Methods](/docs/stores/payment-methods)** | Which payment methods customers can use |
| **[Fulfillment Methods](/docs/stores/fulfillment-methods)** | Delivery, pickup, dine-in options |
| **[Service Fees](/docs/stores/service-fees)** | Additional service or dine-in charges |
| **[Delivery Zones](/docs/stores/delivery-zones)** | Delivery areas and fees |
| **[Online Store](/docs/online-store/storefront-overview)** | Your online storefront settings |
| **[Receipt Settings](/docs/stores/receipt-settings)** | How receipts are formatted |

<Callout title="Shortcut">
Many store settings are also available as **direct sidebar items**. For example, you can access **Delivery Zones**, **Payment Methods**, **Fulfillment Methods**, and **Service Fees** directly from the sidebar without navigating through store details.
</Callout>

## Editing Store Settings

1. Go to **Settings > Store Details** in the sidebar.
2. Click the **Store Settings** action card.
3. Update your store details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Store Name** | A name to identify this store (e.g., "Main Branch") |
| **Address** | The physical address of the store |
| **Currency** | The currency for all transactions in this store |
| **Tax Settings** | Default tax rate and whether prices include tax |

4. Click **Save Changes**.

<Callout title="Important">
The **currency** you choose for a store cannot be changed after creation. Make sure it is correct.
</Callout>

## Multi-Store Operations

If your plan supports multiple stores:

- **Each store tracks inventory independently.** A product can have different stock levels in each store.
- **Orders are associated with a specific store.** When creating an order, you select which store it belongs to.
- **Reports can be filtered by store.** View sales, profit, and other analytics per store or across all stores.
- **Users can be assigned to specific stores.** Control which team members can access which stores.

<Callout title="Tip">
You can transfer inventory between stores. See [Adjustments & Transfers](/docs/inventory/adjustments-transfers) for details on stock transfers.
