## What are Receipt Settings?

Receipt settings let you customize the **printed or digital receipt** that accompanies each order. You can control what information appears on the receipt and how it is formatted.

## How to Configure Receipt Settings

1. Go to **Settings > Receipt Settings** in the sidebar. If you have multiple stores, you will be asked to select a store first.
2. Customize the receipt fields.
3. Click **Save Changes**.

<Callout title="Alternative Access">
You can also reach receipt settings from **Settings > Store Details**, then click on your store, and choose the **Receipt Config** action card.

## What You Can Customize

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Store Name** | Displayed at the top of the receipt |
| **Store Address** | Your store's address printed on the receipt |
| **Store Phone** | Contact phone number |
| **Tax Number** | Your business tax registration number |
| **Header Text** | Custom text at the top of the receipt |
| **Footer Text** | Custom text at the bottom (e.g., "Thank you for your visit!") |
| **Show Logo** | Whether to include your store logo |

## Printing Receipts

You can print a receipt from any order:

1. Open the **Order Details** page.
2. Click **Print Receipt**.
3. A print dialog will open with the receipt formatted according to your settings.

<Callout title="Tip">
You can print receipts at any time after an order is created, not just at the time of sale. Open the order details and click Print Receipt whenever you need a copy.
