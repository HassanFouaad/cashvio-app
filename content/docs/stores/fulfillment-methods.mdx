## What are Fulfillment Methods?

Fulfillment methods define **how orders are delivered to customers**. When creating an order, you or the customer selects a fulfillment method. Each store can enable different methods.

## Available Fulfillment Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **In-Store** | The customer purchases and receives the product at the store. |
| **Pickup** | The customer places the order and picks it up at the store later. |
| **Delivery** | The order is delivered to the customer's address. |
| **Dine-In** | The customer orders and eats at the store (for restaurants/cafés). |

## How to Configure Fulfillment Methods

1. Click **Fulfillment Methods** in the sidebar. If you have multiple stores, you will be asked to select a store first.
2. You will see the list of fulfillment methods.
3. Enable or disable each method.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

## Delivery Fulfillment

When **Delivery** is enabled, creating an order with delivery requires:

- A **delivery address** (country, city, additional details)
- The system can apply **delivery fees** based on the delivery zone

See [Delivery Zones](/docs/stores/delivery-zones) for setting up delivery areas and fees.

## Order Status Tracking

Each fulfillment method follows a status flow:

**In-Store / Pickup / Dine-In:**
1. **Pending** — Order created, waiting to be prepared
2. **Preparing** — Order is being prepared
3. **Ready** — Order is ready for the customer
4. **Completed** — Customer received the order

**Delivery:**
1. **Pending** — Order created
2. **Preparing** — Order is being prepared
3. **Ready** — Ready for dispatch
4. **Delivering** — Out for delivery
5. **Completed** — Delivered to customer

You can update the fulfillment status from the **Order Details** page.

Fulfillment methods also affect the online storefront. Customers shopping on your online store will only see the fulfillment options you have enabled.
