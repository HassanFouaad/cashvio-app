## What are Fulfillment Methods?

Fulfillment methods define **how orders are delivered to customers**. When creating an order in the tenant portal or when a customer checks out on your online store, a fulfillment method is selected. Each store can enable different methods.

## Available Fulfillment Methods

| Method | Description | Available On |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **In-Store** | The customer purchases and receives the product at the store. | Portal only |
| **Pickup** | The customer places the order and picks it up at the store later. | Portal + Storefront |
| **Delivery** | The order is delivered to the customer's address. | Portal + Storefront |
| **Dine-In** | The customer orders and eats at the store (for restaurants/cafes). | Portal only |

## How to Configure Fulfillment Methods

1. Click **Fulfillment Methods** in the sidebar. If you have multiple stores, you will be asked to select a store first.
2. You will see the list of fulfillment methods.
3. Enable or disable each method.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

## Delivery Fulfillment

When **Delivery** is enabled, creating an order with delivery requires:

- A **delivery address** (country, city, additional details)
- The system can apply **delivery fees** based on the delivery zone

See [Delivery Zones](/docs/stores/delivery-zones) for setting up delivery areas and fees.

## Storefront Fulfillment

On your online storefront, customers see only **Delivery** and **Pickup** as fulfillment options (In-Store and Dine-In are portal-only methods). Make sure you have at least one of these enabled if you want customers to place orders through the storefront.

## Order Status Tracking

Each fulfillment method follows a status flow. You can update the fulfillment status from the **Order Details** page.

**In-Store / Pickup / Dine-In:**
1. **Pending** — Order created, waiting to be prepared
2. **Preparing** — Order is being prepared
3. **Ready** — Order is ready for the customer
4. **Completed** — Customer received the order

**Delivery:**
1. **Pending** — Order created
2. **Preparing** — Order is being prepared
3. **Ready** — Ready for dispatch
4. **Delivering** — Out for delivery
5. **Completed** — Delivered to customer

At any stage, an order's fulfillment can also be **Cancelled**.

<Callout title="Tip">
Stay on top of fulfillment status updates. Promptly moving orders through the status flow helps keep your operations organized, especially when managing many orders from both the portal and the storefront simultaneously.
