## What are Service Fees?

Service fees are additional charges added to orders, typically used for **dine-in** or **table service** scenarios. For example, a restaurant might add a 10% service charge to all dine-in orders.

Service fees appear as a separate line item in the order summary, making it transparent for the customer.

## How to Configure Service Fees

1. Click **Service Fees** in the sidebar. If you have multiple stores, you will be asked to select a store first.
2. Configure the fee:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fee Type** | Choose between a fixed amount or a percentage |
| **Fee Value** | Enter the amount or percentage |
| **Applicable Fulfillment Methods** | Select which [fulfillment methods](/docs/stores/fulfillment-methods) the fee applies to (usually Dine-In) |

3. Click **Save Changes**.

You can also reach service fees from **Settings > Store Details**, then click on your store, and choose the **Service Fees** action card.

## How Service Fees Appear on Orders

When an order uses a fulfillment method that has a service fee:

- The fee is automatically added to the order total
- It appears as **Service Fee** in the order summary
- The fee is calculated based on the subtotal (before tax)

**Example:**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Subtotal | 200 EGP |
| Service Fee (10%) | 20 EGP |
| Tax (14%) | 30.80 EGP |
| **Total** | **250.80 EGP** |

See [Pricing & Tax Calculations](/docs/calculations/pricing-tax-calculations) for a full breakdown of how totals are computed.

## Overriding Service Fees on an Order

When [creating an order](/docs/orders/creating-orders), you can **manually adjust** the service fee:

1. In the order summary section, find the **Service Fee** line.
2. Click on the fee amount to edit it.
3. Enter the new amount.
4. The order total updates automatically.

<Callout title="Note">
Overriding the service fee only affects the current order. The default fee setting remains unchanged for future orders.
