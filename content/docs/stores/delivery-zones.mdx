## What are Delivery Zones?

Delivery zones define **where your store delivers** and **how much delivery costs** for each area. When a customer places a delivery order, the system checks their address against your delivery zones to determine the delivery fee.

## How to Set Up Delivery Zones

1. Click **Delivery Zones** in the sidebar. If you have multiple stores, you will be asked to select a store first.
2. You will see the list of existing delivery zones for that store.
3. Click **Add Delivery Zone**.
4. Fill in the zone details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Zone Name** | A name for this area (e.g., "Downtown", "Suburbs") |
| **Area Coverage** | The geographic area this zone covers |
| **Delivery Fee** | The fee charged for delivering to this zone |

5. Click **Save**.

<Callout title="Alternative Access">
You can also reach delivery zones from **Settings > Store Details**, then click on your store, and choose the **Delivery Zones** action card.

## Managing Delivery Zones

- **Edit a zone** — Click on an existing zone to update its fee or coverage area.
- **Delete a zone** — Remove a zone if you no longer deliver there.
- **Multiple zones** — Create as many zones as needed to cover your delivery area.

## How Delivery Fees Affect Orders

When [creating a delivery order](/docs/orders/creating-orders):

1. The delivery address is matched to a delivery zone.
2. The corresponding **delivery fee** is automatically added to the order.
3. The fee appears in the order summary as a separate line item.

You can **manually override** the delivery fee on any individual order during order creation.

<Callout title="Important">
Delivery zones also apply to your **[online store](/docs/online-store/storefront-overview)**. Customers placing delivery orders on your storefront will see the delivery fee based on their selected area.
