## What are Delivery Zones?

Delivery zones define **where your store delivers** and **how much delivery costs** for each area. When a customer places a delivery order (in the portal or on the storefront), the system checks their address against your delivery zones to determine the delivery fee.

## How to Set Up Delivery Zones

1. Click **Delivery Zones** in the sidebar. If you have multiple stores, you will be asked to select a store first.
2. You will see the list of existing delivery zones for that store.
3. Click **Add Delivery Zone**.
4. Fill in the zone details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Zone Name** | A name for this area (e.g., "Downtown", "Suburbs") |
| **Country** | The country this zone covers |
| **Cities** | The cities within that country included in this zone |
| **Delivery Fee** | The fee charged for delivering to this zone |

5. Click **Save**.

## Managing Delivery Zones

- **Edit a zone** — Click on an existing zone to update its fee, cities, or coverage area.
- **Delete a zone** — Remove a zone if you no longer deliver there.
- **Multiple zones** — Create as many zones as needed to cover your delivery area.

## How Delivery Zones Affect the Portal

When [creating a delivery order](/docs/orders/creating-orders) in the tenant portal:

1. The delivery address is matched to a delivery zone.
2. The corresponding **delivery fee** is automatically added to the order.
3. The fee appears in the order summary as a separate line item.

You can **manually override** the delivery fee on any individual order during order creation.

## How Delivery Zones Affect the Storefront

When a customer places a delivery order on your [online store](/docs/online-store/checkout-flow):

1. The **Country** dropdown shows only countries from your configured delivery zones.
2. The **City** dropdown shows only cities from the matching zone.
3. The delivery fee is automatically applied based on the selected zone.
4. If no delivery zones are configured, the storefront shows the full list of countries and cities without a delivery fee.

<Callout title="Important">
Setting up delivery zones is recommended if you offer delivery through the storefront. It ensures customers only select areas you actually deliver to, and the correct delivery fee is applied automatically.
