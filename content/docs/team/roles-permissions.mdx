## What are Roles?

A **role** defines what a team member can see and do in Cashvio. Each role has a set of **permissions** that control access to different features. For example, a "Cashier" role might only have permission to create orders, while a "Manager" role might have full access.

## How Permissions Work

Permissions are grouped by module. For each module, you can grant or deny access to specific actions:

| Module | Available Permissions |
|--------|-----------------------|
| **Orders** | View, Create, Edit, Cancel |
| **Products** | View, Create, Edit, Delete |
| **Categories** | View, Create, Edit, Delete |
| **Customers** | View, Create, Edit, Delete |
| **Inventory** | View, Adjust, Transfer |
| **Suppliers** | View, Create, Edit, Delete |
| **Purchase Orders** | View, Create, Approve, Receive, Cancel |
| **Returns** | View, Create, Approve, Reject |
| **Refunds** | View, Create, Process |
| **Users** | View, Invite, Edit, Delete |
| **Roles** | View, Create, Edit, Delete |
| **Reports** | View |
| **Settings** | View, Edit |
| **Stores** | View, Create, Edit |

## Creating a Role

1. Go to **Roles & Permissions** (or **الأدوار والصلاحيات** in Arabic) in the sidebar.
2. Click **Create Role**.
3. Fill in:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Role Name** | A name for this role (e.g., "Cashier", "Warehouse Staff") |
| **Description** | An optional description of what this role is for |

4. Select the **permissions** for this role. Permissions are organized by module — expand each section and check the actions you want to allow.
5. Click **Save**.

## Editing a Role

1. Go to **Roles & Permissions** in the sidebar.
2. Click on the role you want to edit.
3. Update the name, description, or permissions.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

## How Roles Affect the Interface

When a user logs in, their role determines:

- **Which sidebar menu items they see** — Only modules they have "View" permission for appear.
- **Which actions they can perform** — Buttons like "Create Order" or "Delete Product" only appear if the user has the corresponding permission.
- **Which Dashboard quick actions appear** — Only actions the user is allowed to perform are shown.

<Callout title="Important">
The account owner (business owner) always has full access to everything, regardless of role settings. Roles only restrict invited team members.
</Callout>

## Default Roles vs Custom Roles

Cashvio may provide some default roles. You can create as many custom roles as you need for your team structure. Common examples:

- **Store Manager** — Full access to one store
- **Cashier** — Can only create orders and view products
- **Inventory Staff** — Can manage inventory and purchase orders
- **Accountant** — Can view reports and financial data
