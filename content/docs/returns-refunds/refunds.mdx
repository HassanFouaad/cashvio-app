A **refund** returns money to a customer for a completed order. Refunds can be full (the entire order amount) or partial (only part of the order).

## Creating a Refund

Refunds are created from the order details:

1. Open the **Order Details** page.
2. Click **Create Refund**.

## How Refunds Affect Financials

- The refund amount is recorded in the order's payment history.
- Refunds using **Store Credit** increase the customer's store credit balance.
- Reports and analytics reflect refunded amounts in the relevant metrics.

<Callout title="Important">
Refunds do not automatically restore inventory. If a customer returned products, create a **[Return](/docs/returns-refunds/returns)** first to handle inventory restoration, then create a refund for the money.
