## What is a Refund?

A **refund** returns money to a customer for a completed order. Refunds can be full (the entire order amount) or partial (only part of the order).

2. Click **Create Refund**.
3. Fill in the refund details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Refund Method** | How the money will be returned to the customer |
| **Amount** | The refund amount |
| **Notes** | Optional notes about the refund |

4. Review and click **Submit**.

### Refund Methods

| Method | Description |

| **Cash** | Refund given as physical cash |
| **Card Reversal** | Refund back to the original card |
| **Store Credit** | Refund added to customer's store credit balance |
| **InstaPay** | Refund via InstaPay |

## Managing Refunds

### Refunds List Page

Cashvio provides a dedicated **Refunds** list page where you can view and manage all refunds across your store. Access it from **Sales > Refunds** (or **المبالغ المستردة**) in the sidebar.

The refunds list displays:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Refund Number** | Unique refund identifier |
| **Order Number** | The related order |
| **Customer** | Customer name |
| **Status** | Pending, Processed, or Cancelled |
| **Method** | The refund method |
| **Amount** | Refund amount |
| **Date** | When the refund was created |

### Filtering Refunds

You can filter the refunds list by:

- **Order ID** — Find refunds for a specific order
- **Status** — Filter by Pending, Processed, or Cancelled
- **Refund Method** — Filter by payment method (Cash, Card Reversal, Store Credit, etc.)
- **Date Range** — Filter refunds created within a specific time period

### Viewing Refunds from Order Details

Refunds are also visible from the order details page under the **Refunds** section. Each refund shows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Refund Number** | Unique refund identifier |
| **Order Number** | The related order |
| **Status** | Pending, Processed, or Cancelled |
| **Method** | The refund method |
| **Amount** | Refund amount |
| **Date** | When the refund was created |

## Refund Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | Refund created, waiting to be processed |
| **Processed** | Refund has been completed |
| **Cancelled** | Refund was cancelled |

## Processing a Pending Refund

You can process pending refunds from either:
- The **Refunds list page** — Click on a refund to open its details
- The **Order details page** — Navigate to the Refunds section

1. Open the refund details.
2. Review the refund information (amount, method, customer).
3. Click **Process** to confirm the refund has been sent.
4. The status changes to **Processed**.

## Cancelling a Pending Refund

If you need to cancel a pending refund:

1. Open the refund details from the Refunds list or Order details page.
2. Click **Cancel**.
3. The refund status changes to **Cancelled** and the refund will not be processed.

<Callout title="Note">
Only **Pending** refunds can be cancelled. Processed or already cancelled refunds cannot be cancelled.
</Callout>

## How Refunds Affect Financials

- The refund amount is recorded in the order's payment history.
- Refunds using **Store Credit** increase the customer's store credit balance.
- Reports and analytics reflect refunded amounts in the relevant metrics.

<Callout title="Important">
Refunds do not automatically restore inventory. If a customer returned products, create a **[Return](/docs/returns-refunds/returns)** first to handle inventory restoration, then create a refund for the money.
