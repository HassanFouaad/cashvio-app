## What is a Return?

A **return** is when a customer brings back products from a completed order. Returns track which items were returned, why, and how the refund should be processed.

## Return Types

Cashvio supports three types of returns:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Return & Refund** | Physical return of products + refund to customer |
| **Return Only** | Physical return of products, no refund issued |
| **Refund Only** | Refund to customer without requiring physical return |

When creating a return, you select the appropriate type based on your business needs and the customer's situation.

## Creating a Return

Returns are created from a specific order:

1. Open the **Order Details** page for the order you want to return items from.
2. Click **Create Return**.
3. Select the items to return:
   - Check the items the customer is returning
   - Enter the **quantity** being returned for each item
   - Select a **return reason** for each item

### Return Reasons

When creating a return, you must select a reason for each item. The available predefined reasons are:

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Changed Mind** | Customer decided not to keep the product |
| **Wrong Item** | A different product was delivered |
| **Defective** | Product has a manufacturing defect |
| **Damaged** | Product was damaged during delivery or handling |
| **Not as Described** | Product does not match its description |
| **Size/Fit Issue** | Wrong size or does not fit |
| **Quality Issue** | Product quality is below expectations |
| **Duplicate Order** | Customer accidentally ordered twice |
| **Missing Parts** | Product is incomplete or missing accessories |
| **Expired** | Product has passed its expiry date |
| **Other** | Any other reason (add a note) |

### Non-Restock Reasons

When processing a return, you can mark items as **non-restockable** if they cannot be returned to inventory. The available non-restock reasons are:

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Damaged** | Item is too damaged to resell |
| **Defective** | Item has defects that prevent resale |
| **Expired** | Item has passed its expiry date |
| **Contaminated** | Item has been contaminated and cannot be resold |
| **Compensation** | Item given as compensation to customer |
| **Customer Kept** | Customer kept the item despite return request |
| **Quality Issue** | Quality issues prevent resale |
| **Packaging Damaged** | Packaging is damaged and item cannot be resold |
| **Non-Trackable Inventory** | Item is not tracked in inventory system |
| **Other** | Any other reason (add a note) |

4. Review the return summary.
5. Click **Submit** to create the return.

## Managing Returns

Go to **Sales > Returns** (or **المرتجعات**) in the sidebar to see all returns.

The returns list shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Return Number** | Unique identifier for the return |
| **Order Number** | The original order |
| **Customer** | Who is returning the items |
| **Status** | Pending, Approved, Rejected, or Cancelled |
| **Date** | When the return was created |
| **Amount** | The return value |

## Return Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | Return created, waiting for review |
| **Approved** | Return accepted, items will be restocked |
| **Rejected** | Return was denied |
| **Cancelled** | Return was cancelled |

## Approving or Rejecting a Return

1. Open the return details.
2. Review the items and reasons.
3. Click **Approve** or **Reject**.

When a return is **approved**:
- The returned items' inventory is restored (if inventory tracking is enabled and items are marked as restockable)
- Items marked with non-restock reasons are **not** added back to inventory
- A [refund](/docs/returns-refunds/refunds) can be issued from the return or order details (if the return type includes refund)

<Callout title="Note">
Returns and refunds are separate actions. Approving a return does not automatically issue a refund. You need to create a refund separately if you want to return money to the customer.
