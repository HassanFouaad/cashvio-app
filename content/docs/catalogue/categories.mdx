## What are Categories?

Categories help you **organize your products** into groups. For example, a clothing store might have categories like "Shirts", "Pants", and "Accessories". A restaurant might use "Appetizers", "Main Course", and "Desserts".

Every [product](/docs/catalogue/products) in Cashvio belongs to a category.

## How to Create a Category

1. Go to **Catalogue > Categories** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Add New Category**.
3. Fill in the details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Category Name** | The name displayed for this category (e.g., "Electronics") |
| **Description** | An optional description of the category |
| **Image** | An optional image for the category |

4. Click **Save**.

## Viewing Your Categories

The **Categories** page shows a list of all your categories with:

- **Category name**
- **Description**
- **Number of products** in each category

You can search for categories by name using the search bar.

## Editing a Category

1. Click on a category from the list.
2. In the **Category Details** page, click **Edit**.
3. Update the name, description, or image.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

## Deleting a Category

1. Click on the category you want to delete.
2. Click **Delete** from the actions menu.
3. Confirm the deletion.

## How Categories Appear on Your Online Store

If you have an online storefront enabled, categories appear as navigation sections. Customers can browse products by category, making it easier for them to find what they want.

See [Online Store](/docs/online-store/storefront-overview) for more details.
