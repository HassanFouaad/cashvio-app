## What is a Product?

A **product** is an item you sell. Each product has a name, belongs to a [category](/docs/catalogue/categories), and can have multiple **variants** (versions with different sizes, colors, etc.). Products are the core of your catalogue and are used when [creating orders](/docs/orders/creating-orders).

## How to Add a New Product

1. Go to **Catalogue > Products** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Add New Product**.
3. Choose your creation method:
   - **Quick Create** — A simplified form for simple products
   - **Full Form** — A multi-step wizard for products with variants and detailed configuration

### Step 1: Product Information

Fill in the basic details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Product Name** | The name of the product |
| **Description** | An optional description |
| **Category** | The category this product belongs to |
| **Tax Category** | The tax classification for this product |
| **Tax Rate** | The tax percentage applied |
| **Tax Included** | Whether the selling price already includes tax |
| **Status** | Active (visible and sellable) or Draft (hidden) |
| **Track Inventory** | Whether to track stock levels for this product |

### Step 2: Variants and Pricing

Configure the product variants:

- Select which **[options](/docs/catalogue/options)** apply (e.g., Size, Color)
- For each variant, set:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Variant Name** | Auto-generated from option values (e.g., "S / Red") |
| **SKU** | A unique stock keeping unit code |
| **Selling Price** | The price the customer pays |
| **Cost Price** | Your cost to acquire the product (used for profit calculations) |
| **Unit of Measure** | How the product is sold (piece, kg, etc.) |

### Step 3: Product Images

Upload images for the product:

- Add multiple images
- Set a **primary image** (the main image shown in lists)
- Reorder images by dragging

Click **Save** to create the product.

## Viewing Your Products

The **Products** page shows a filterable list:

- **Search** by product name
- **Filter** by category or status (Active, Draft, Archived)
- Each row shows the product name, category, SKU, status, price, and variant count

Click on a product to view its full details.

## Editing a Product

1. Click on a product from the list.
2. On the **Product Details** page:
   - Click **Edit** to modify basic information
   - Click **Edit Images** to manage photos
   - Click **Add Variant** to add a new variant
   - Click on a variant to edit its price, SKU, or stock

## Product Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Active** | The product is visible and can be added to orders |
| **Draft** | The product is saved but not yet visible or sellable |
| **Archived** | The product is no longer available but its history is preserved |

## Inventory Tracking

If **Track Inventory** is enabled for a product:

- Each variant's stock level is tracked per store
- Stock decreases when an order is completed
- Stock increases when inventory is adjusted or purchase orders are received
- **Low stock alerts** appear when stock falls below the reorder point (see [Stock Management](/docs/inventory/stock-management))

If inventory tracking is **disabled**, the product is treated as always in stock.
