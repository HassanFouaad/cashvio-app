## What is a Product?

A **product** is an item you sell. Each product has a name, belongs to a [category](/docs/catalogue/categories), and can have multiple **variants** (versions with different sizes, colors, etc.). Products are the core of your catalogue and are used when [creating orders](/docs/orders/creating-orders).

## How to Add a New Product

1. Go to **Catalogue > Products** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Add New Product**.
3. Choose your creation method:
   - **Quick Create** — A simplified form for simple products
   - **Full Form** — A multi-step wizard for products with variants and detailed configuration

### Step 1: Product Information

Fill in the basic details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Product Name** | The name of the product |
| **Description** | An optional description |
| **Category** | The category this product belongs to |
| **Status** | Active (visible and sellable), Draft (hidden), or Archived (no longer available) |
| **Tax Category** | The tax classification for this product (overrides store-level tax settings) |
| **Tax Rate** | The tax percentage applied to this product (can be different from store default) |
| **Tax Included** | Toggle to indicate if the selling price already includes tax |
| **Track Inventory** | Whether to track stock levels for this product |
| **Product Tags** | Optional tags for organizing and filtering products (e.g., "sale", "new", "featured") |

### Step 2: Variants and Pricing

Configure the product variants:

- Select which **[options](/docs/catalogue/options)** apply (e.g., Size, Color)
- For each variant, set:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Variant Name** | Auto-generated from option values (e.g., "S / Red") |
| **SKU** | A unique stock keeping unit code |
| **Selling Price** | The price the customer pays |
| **Cost Price** | Your cost to acquire the product (required for accurate profit calculations) |
| **Unit of Measure** | How the product is sold: kg, g, L, m, pcs, unit, m², m³, or other custom unit |

<Callout title="Important">
**Cost Price** is essential for profit reporting. Without accurate cost prices, profit calculations in the [Reports](/docs/reports/analytics-reports) section will be incorrect.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Product Images

Upload images for the product:

- **Multiple Images** — Add up to multiple images per product
- **Primary Image** — Set the main image shown in product lists and as the default
- **Image Order** — Reorder images by dragging (the first image is the primary)
- **Alt Text** — Add descriptive alt text for each image for accessibility and SEO

<Callout title="Tip">
Use high-quality images and descriptive alt text to improve your product's visibility in search results and provide better accessibility.
</Callout>

### Step 4: Store-Specific Pricing (Multi-Store)

If you have multiple stores, you can set different prices for each store:

1. After creating the product, go to the **Pricing** section.
2. Click **Add Store Price**.
3. Select the store and enter the selling price for that store.
4. Repeat for each store that should have a different price.

If no store-specific price is set, the product uses the default selling price for all stores.

Click **Save** to create the product.

## Viewing Your Products

The **Products** page shows a filterable list:

- **Search** by product name
- **Filter** by category or status (Active, Draft, Archived)
- Each row shows the product name, category, SKU, status, price, and variant count

Click on a product to view its full details.

## Editing a Product

1. Click on a product from the list.
2. On the **Product Details** page:
   - Click **Edit** to modify basic information (name, description, category, status, tax settings, tags)
   - Click **Edit Images** to manage photos (add, remove, reorder, set primary, add alt text)
   - Click **Edit Pricing** to modify store-specific prices
   - Click **Add Variant** to add a new variant
   - Click on a variant to edit its price, cost price, SKU, unit of measure, or stock

### Managing Product Tags

Tags help you organize and filter products:

- **Add Tags** — Enter tags separated by commas (e.g., "sale, featured, new")
- **Filter by Tags** — Use tags to quickly find products in the product list
- **Tag Management** — Edit or remove tags from the product edit page

Tags are useful for creating product collections or running promotions on specific product groups.

## Product Statuses

Each product has a status that controls its visibility and availability:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Active** | The product is visible in the catalogue, can be added to orders, and appears on the [online storefront](/docs/online-store/storefront-overview) |
| **Draft** | The product is saved but not visible to customers or in order creation. Use this for products you're still working on |
| **Archived** | The product is no longer available for sale, but its history is preserved. Archived products don't appear in product lists but remain in order history |

You can change a product's status at any time from the product details page.

## Tax Settings per Product

Each product can have its own tax configuration, which overrides store-level tax settings:

- **Tax Category** — Classify the product for tax purposes (e.g., Standard, Reduced Rate, Zero Rate, Exempt)
- **Tax Rate** — Set a specific tax percentage for this product
- **Tax Included** — Toggle this if your selling price already includes tax (the system will calculate the tax-inclusive amount correctly)

<Callout title="Note">
If you don't set product-specific tax settings, the product will use the store's default tax configuration. See [Pricing & Tax Calculations](/docs/calculations/pricing-tax-calculations) for more details.
</Callout>

## Inventory Tracking

If **Track Inventory** is enabled for a product:

- Each variant's stock level is tracked per store
- Stock decreases when an order is completed
- Stock increases when inventory is adjusted or purchase orders are received
- **Low stock alerts** appear when stock falls below the reorder point (see [Stock Management](/docs/inventory/stock-management))

If inventory tracking is **disabled**, the product is treated as always in stock.

<Callout title="Tip">
Set up your categories and options **before** creating products. This makes the product creation process faster and more organized.

## Deleting a Product

1. Open the product details.
2. Click **Delete**.
3. Confirm the deletion.

<Callout title="Warning">
Deleting a product removes it permanently. Orders that included this product will still show the product name in their history.
</Callout>
