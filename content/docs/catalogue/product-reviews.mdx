## What are Product Reviews?

**Product Reviews** allow your customers to leave ratings and comments on products they've purchased from your [online store](/docs/online-store/storefront-overview). Reviews build trust with potential buyers and improve your store's SEO through rich snippets (star ratings in search results).

Each review contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Reviewer Name** | The name the customer provides when submitting |
| **Star Rating** | A rating from 1 to 5 stars |
| **Comment** | The customer's written feedback |
| **Status** | Either **Pending** (awaiting your approval) or **Displayed** (visible on the storefront) |

## How Reviews Work

1. A customer visits your product page on the online store.
2. They fill in their name, select a star rating, and write a comment.
3. The review is submitted with a **Pending** status — it is **not** visible to other customers yet.
4. You receive a push notification that a new review has been submitted.
5. You review the submission in the Business Portal and either **approve** or keep it hidden.
6. Once approved (status changed to **Displayed**), the review appears publicly on the product page.

<Callout title="Moderation First">
All reviews start as **Pending**. No review is shown to customers until you explicitly approve it. This gives you full control over what's displayed on your storefront.

## Managing Reviews in the Business Portal

### Viewing Reviews

1. Go to **Catalogue > Products** and click on a product.
2. Scroll down to the **Reviews** section below the product details.
3. You'll see a table with all reviews, including the reviewer name, star rating, comment, status, and date.

### Filtering by Status

Use the toggle buttons above the reviews table to filter:

- **All** — Show all reviews
- **Pending** — Show only reviews awaiting moderation
- **Displayed** — Show only approved/visible reviews

### Approving a Review

To make a pending review visible on the storefront:

1. Find the review in the table.
2. Click the **green checkmark** button in the Actions column.
3. The status changes to **Displayed** and the review becomes visible to customers.

### Hiding a Review

To hide a previously approved review:

1. Find the displayed review in the table.
2. Click the **hide** button (eye-off icon) in the Actions column.
3. The status changes back to **Pending** and the review is removed from the storefront.

<Callout title="Tip">
Regularly check the **Pending** filter for new reviews. Timely moderation shows customers that you value their feedback.

## Reviews on the Storefront

On the product page, approved reviews are displayed with:

- An **average star rating** and total review count at the top
- Individual **review cards** showing the reviewer's name, star rating, comment, and date
- A **Submit Review** form where visitors can leave new reviews

### SEO Benefits

Product reviews automatically generate **Schema.org structured data** (JSON-LD) on your product pages:

- **AggregateRating** — The average star rating and total review count
- **Individual Reviews** — Each review with its author, rating, date, and content

This structured data enables **rich snippets** in Google search results, showing star ratings directly in the search listing — which significantly improves click-through rates.

<Callout title="Note">
Rich snippets appear in search results only after Google re-crawls your product pages. This may take a few days after reviews are approved.

## Notifications

When a customer submits a review, you receive a **push notification** on all your registered devices. The notification includes:

- The product name
- The reviewer's name
- The star rating

This ensures you never miss a new review and can moderate it promptly.
