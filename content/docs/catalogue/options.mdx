## What are Product Options?

Product options are **attributes** that differentiate versions of the same product. Common examples include:

- **Size** — Small, Medium, Large, XL
- **Color** — Red, Blue, Black, White
- **Material** — Cotton, Polyester, Leather

Options are reusable — once you create a "Size" option, you can apply it to any product that comes in different sizes.

## How Options and Variants Work Together

When you add options to a product, Cashvio creates **variants** (product versions). Each combination of option values becomes a separate variant with its own:

- **SKU** (Stock Keeping Unit)
- **Selling Price**
- **Cost Price**
- **Inventory level**

**Example:** A T-shirt with Size (S, M, L) and Color (Red, Blue) creates 6 variants:
- T-shirt / S / Red
- T-shirt / S / Blue
- T-shirt / M / Red
- T-shirt / M / Blue
- T-shirt / L / Red
- T-shirt / L / Blue

## How to Create an Option

1. Go to **Catalogue > Options** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Add Option**.
3. Enter the option details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Option Name** | What this attribute is called (e.g., "Size", "Color") |
| **Option Values** | The available choices (e.g., "S", "M", "L", "XL") |

4. Click **Save**.

## Managing Options

On the **Options** page, you can see all your options with their values and how many products use each one.

- **Edit an option** — Click to update the name or add/remove values.
- **Delete an option** — Remove an option you no longer need.

<Callout title="Important">
Changing or deleting option values may affect existing product variants. Be careful when modifying options that are already in use.

## Using Options When Creating Products

When you create a new product, you can select which options apply to it. Cashvio automatically generates all the variant combinations. You can then set individual prices and SKUs for each variant.

See [Products](/docs/catalogue/products) for the full product creation workflow.
