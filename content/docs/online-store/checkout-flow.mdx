## How Checkout Works

When a customer is ready to buy from your online store, they go through the checkout process:

### Step 1: Cart Review

The customer reviews their cart:
- All selected products with quantities
- Subtotal, delivery fee (if applicable), tax, and total
- They can adjust quantities or remove items
- Click **Proceed to Checkout**

### Step 2: Fulfillment Selection

The customer chooses how they want to receive their order:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Delivery** | Order shipped to their address |
| **Pickup** | Customer picks up from the store |
| **Dine-In** | Customer eats at the store (if applicable) |

Only the fulfillment methods you have **enabled** in the store settings are shown.

### Step 3: Customer Information

The customer fills in their details:
- **Name** — First and last name
- **Phone Number** — Contact number

If **Delivery** is selected:
- **Country**
- **City**
- **Detailed Address**

### Step 4: Order Notes (Optional)

The customer can add special instructions or notes for the order.

### Step 5: Order Review

A final summary showing:
- All items with prices
- Subtotal
- Delivery fee (for delivery orders)
- Service fee (if applicable)
- Tax
- **Total amount**

### Step 6: Place Order

The customer clicks **Place Order**. The order is created in your Cashvio portal.

## After the Order is Placed

- The customer sees an **Order Success** page with their order number.
- The order appears in your **Sales** list in the tenant portal.
- You can then process payments, update fulfillment status, and manage the order as usual.

<Callout title="Note">
Online orders from the storefront appear in your Orders list just like orders created manually in the portal. They can be managed the same way.
