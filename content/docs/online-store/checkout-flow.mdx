## How Checkout Works

When a customer is ready to buy from your online store, they go through the checkout process:

### Step 1: Cart Review

The customer reviews their cart:
- All selected products with quantities
- Subtotal, delivery fee (if applicable), tax, and total
- They can adjust quantities or remove items
- Click **Proceed to Checkout**

### Step 2: Fulfillment Selection

The customer chooses how they want to receive their order:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Delivery** | Order delivered to their address |
| **Pickup** | Customer picks up from the store |

Only the fulfillment methods you have **enabled** in the store settings are shown. Delivery and Pickup are the available options for the online storefront.

### Step 3: Delivery Address (If Delivery)

If the customer selects **Delivery**:

- **Country** — Select from your configured [delivery zones](/docs/stores/delivery-zones), or from the general countries list
- **City** — Select from the available cities
- **Detailed Address** — Enter the full delivery address

<Callout title="Note">
If you have configured delivery zones, only the countries and cities in your zones appear. Delivery fees are applied automatically based on the selected zone.
</Callout>

### Step 4: Payment Method

The customer selects how they want to pay:

| Method | How It Works |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cash** | Pay on delivery or pickup. A pending payment record is created — you mark it as received from the business portal. |
| **Receipt** | The customer uploads a photo of their payment receipt (bank transfer, InstaPay, etc.) as proof of payment. A pending payment is created with the receipt attached. You review and accept it from the business portal. |

Only the storefront payment methods you have enabled for the store are shown.

#### Receipt Upload

When the customer selects **Receipt**:

1. A modern upload area appears.
2. The customer clicks to select a receipt image (JPEG, PNG, or WebP).
3. The image uploads automatically.
4. A success confirmation appears once the upload is complete.
5. The receipt is attached to the order payment and visible to you in the business portal.

<Callout title="Important">
If your store has **no active storefront payment methods**, the checkout page displays a warning message: "Payments are currently unavailable. This store is not accepting payments at the moment." The customer cannot place the order until payment methods are configured. Make sure you have at least one storefront payment method enabled.
</Callout>

### Step 5: Customer Information

The customer fills in their details:
- **Name** — First and last name
- **Phone Number** — Contact number

### Step 6: Order Notes (Optional)

The customer can add special instructions or notes for the order.

### Step 7: Order Review

A final summary showing:
- All items with prices
- Subtotal
- Delivery fee (for delivery orders)
- Service fee (if applicable)
- Tax
- **Total amount**
- Selected payment method

The customer must also meet the **minimum order value** if one is configured. If the cart total is below the minimum, a warning is displayed and the order cannot be placed.

### Step 8: Place Order

The customer clicks **Place Order**. The order is created in your Cashvio portal.

## After the Order is Placed

- The customer sees an **Order Success** page with their order number and a countdown redirect back to the store.
- The order appears in your **Sales** list in the business portal with the order source marked as **Storefront**.
- Payment records are created based on the payment method:
  - **Cash** — A **pending** payment record. Mark it as completed when the customer pays.
  - **Receipt** — A **pending** payment record with the uploaded receipt image. Review the receipt and accept it from the order details.

## Managing Storefront Orders

Storefront orders appear alongside your portal orders in the Sales list. You can identify them by the **Order Source** column showing "Storefront".

To process storefront orders:

1. **Review the order** — Check items, customer info, and delivery address.
2. **Process the payment** — For Cash orders, mark the payment as received. For Receipt orders, review the uploaded receipt and click **Accept Payment Receipt**.
3. **Update fulfillment** — Move the order through the fulfillment stages (Pending → Preparing → Ready → Delivering → Completed).

<Callout title="Note">
Storefront orders behave exactly like portal orders once created. You manage them the same way — update fulfillment status, add payments, create returns, and issue refunds as needed.
