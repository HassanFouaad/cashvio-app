## What is the Online Store?

The **Online Store** (or storefront) is a customer-facing website where people can browse your products, add items to cart, and place orders online. Each store in Cashvio can have its own storefront with a unique subdomain.

## How Customers Experience Your Store

When customers visit your storefront, they see:

### Home Page
- **Hero images** — Large banner images you configure
- **Featured categories** — Your product categories for easy browsing
- **Featured products** — A selection of your active products

### Product Browsing
- **All Products** page with search, sorting, and filtering
- **Category pages** showing products in each category
- **Product detail** pages with images, descriptions, variant selection, and pricing

### Shopping Cart
- Customers add products to their cart
- They can adjust quantities, remove items, and see the order summary
- The cart shows subtotal, shipping, tax, and total

### Language Support
- Customers can switch between **English** and **Arabic**
- The entire storefront supports RTL (right-to-left) for Arabic

### Theme
- Customers can toggle between **light** and **dark** mode

## Configuring Your Online Store

From the **tenant portal**, go to your store's settings and navigate to **Online Store** (or **المتجر الإلكتروني**).
