## What is the Online Store?

The **Online Store** (or storefront) is a customer-facing website where people can browse your products, add items to cart, and place orders online. Each store in Cashvio can have its own storefront accessible via a unique subdomain (e.g., `mystore.cash-vio.com`).

<Callout title="Important">
Cashvio supports **subdomain-based storefronts only** (format: `yourstorename.cash-vio.com`). Custom domains are not currently available.

<Callout title="Important">
Only **active** products and categories appear on the storefront. Draft or archived items are hidden from customers. If "Hide Out of Stock Items" is enabled, products with zero inventory are also hidden.
