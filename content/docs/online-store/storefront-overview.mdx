## What is the Online Store?

The **Online Store** (or storefront) is a customer-facing website where people can browse your products, add items to cart, and place orders online. Each store in Cashvio can have its own storefront accessible via a unique subdomain (e.g., `mystore.cash-vio.com`).

<Callout title="Important">
Cashvio supports **subdomain-based storefronts only** (format: `yourstorename.cash-vio.com`). Custom domains are not currently available.

## What Affects Your Online Store

Your storefront is connected to the tenant portal. Changes you make in the portal are reflected on the storefront:

|----------------|-------------------|
| **Products** | Products with "Active" status appear on the store |
| **Categories** | Active categories appear in navigation and browsing |

| **Delivery Zones** | Available delivery areas and fees during checkout |
| **Storefront Payment Methods** | Cash and Receipt appear during checkout based on your configuration |
| **Service Fees** | Delivery and service fees are applied during checkout |

<Callout title="Important">
Only **active** products and categories appear on the storefront. Draft or archived items are hidden from customers. If "Hide Out of Stock Items" is enabled, products with zero inventory are also hidden.
